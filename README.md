# RFID Locker
 
This project involved the development of an access control system utilizing the Arduino Uno Rev3 platform, an RFID card reader, LCD display, 5 V relay, and a 12 V bolt lock. The primary goal was to facilitate lock opening exclusively through a designated RFID card. Notifications on the LCD display were implemented to inform the user in the event of a recognized or invalid card presentation.
